# personal-site

Goals: Simplicity, clarity, flow. 

Elements shouldn't be overlapping now
Foundation is pretty awesome, just need to learn sass/scss!

Planned Features:
  - use of buttons softly scolls the visitor to the next part of webpage.
  - Navigation menu side pop-out? (good jquery practice)
  - slight animations to buttons or other elements
  - make button:hover color change slower
  - A secret link to some kind of easter egg?!?!?! omgomg.
